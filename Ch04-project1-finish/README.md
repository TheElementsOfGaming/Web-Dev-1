# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 4 [CSS 1], Project 1 [Travel]
This project updates your existing project from Chapter 3 to add some visual stylistic
improvements with CSS. Reminder: this (and the other chapter projects) are not
meant to be step-by-step tutorials (the separate hands-on exercises available from
Pearson using the code at the front of the book perform that function). Rather they
are meant as self-guided practice exercises for you to apply and assess your knowledge
of the chapterâ€™s content.
